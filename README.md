dyi cms for telegram channels

## idea

* Telegram generates a lot of media (text, images, video, audio) content. At the same time, viewing/searching capabilities are limited to the chat/channel communication pattern.

* Telecms is an experimental CMS (content management system) for public channels that aims to enhance telegram user experience with dynamic tools that allow searching, matching, selecting and sharing media.
